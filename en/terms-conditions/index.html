              Welcome to Eco.com. When you visit this website (the “Site”) and

              with its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents,
              representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors,
              “Eco” or “Eco.com”), you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms of
              Service (the “Terms”). You also agree that your use of our
              services is subject to our Privacy Policy, which describes—among
              other things—how we collect, use, and protect the information you
              provide us.<br /><br />We may need to update these Terms from time
              to time. We’ll notify you of any material changes if we do, either
              on the site or by sending you an email. Visiting the Site and
              using the services after we change the Terms constitutes your
              acceptance of the new Terms.<br />

            <h2>Eco Services</h2>
            <p>
              Eco allows you to buy, receive, hold and transfer funds in virtual
              currency in accordance with the terms herein (the “Eco Services”).
              The role of Eco in all cases is that of an independent contractor.
              You shall have no authority to act on behalf of Eco or to bind it,
              and in no event will your relationship with Eco be construed to be
              that of partners, employer employee, or agents of each other,
              unless explicitly stated herein.
            </p>
            <h2>Eco ID</h2>
            <p>
              Using Eco’s Services requires you to submit your information to
              Eco, and may require you to submit to certain customer
              verification processes. After you submit your information and
              complete the required customer verification, you may receive an
              Eco ID or an identity credential from one of our partners. This is
              the account you use to access Eco’s Services, your Eco account,
              and any third-party applications provided on Eco.com. You’re
              responsible for maintaining your credential’s confidentiality and
              security, and for all activity on your account. Eco is not
              responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of
              your identity credential. If you find out that someone is using
              your account without your permission, report it to
              security@eco.com.
            </p>
            <p>
              Submitting your information to Eco does not guarantee that you
              will receive an identity credential or that you will access Eco’s
              Services. Unless notified otherwise you must be at least 18 years
              old to use Eco’s Services and to sign up for an identity
              credential.<br />‍
            </p>
            <h2>Eco Services</h2>
            <p>These are the basic rules we need you to abide by:</p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li>You may only use Eco’s Services for non-commercial uses.</li>
              <li>
                You may not interfere with the proper workings of Eco&#x27;s
                Services or use Eco&#x27;s Services in any way that could
                damage, disable, or overburden the Site or Eco&#x27;s Services
                or the networks or services connected to Eco’s Services.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may not take any action on the Site that infringes or
                violates other people’s rights, violates the law, or breaches
                any contract or legal duty you have toward anyone.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may not do anything threatening, abusive, harassing,
                defamatory, libelous, tortious, obscene, profane, or invasive of
                another person’s privacy on Eco.com.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may only submit true, accurate, current and complete
                information to us.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you create an “Account” (a registered account with us made
                through the website or App), you will keep it secure and safe,
                maintain it up to date, and not let anyone else use it.
              </li>
              <li>
                You also agree to use reasonable efforts to utilize one or more
                of the following multi-factor authentication methods in order to
                provide further security to your account: (i) phone number, (ii)
                email address, or (iii) such other method as may be offered by
                Eco in its sole discretion.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you are accessing your Eco account from a new device (or if
                you are logging into your Eco account for the first time), you
                may be required to log in using your email, username or
                password, then complete a multi-factor authentication process.
                Once you confirm your identity via the multi-factor
                authentication process, you will have full access to your Eco
                account.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Third Party Applications &amp; Sites</h2>
            <p>
              Third Party Applications available on Eco.com also have their own
              terms and policies (“Third Party Terms”). By using these Third
              Party Applications, you agree to any applicable Third Party Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eco may also occasionally link to other sites. These links are
              provided only as a convenience, and you access them at your own
              risk.<br />
            </p>
            <h2>Eco’s Rights</h2>
            <ul role="list">
              <li>
                Eco may make changes to the Site and Eco&#x27;s Services at any
                time without notice or liability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Eco has the right to decide who is eligible to use Eco’s
                Services, and can cancel accounts or decline to offer Eco’s
                Services. If these options are prohibited by law where you live,
                then Eco may revoke your right to use Eco&#x27;s Services in
                that jurisdiction.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Eco is not liable for any damages or losses related to your use of
              Eco&#x27;s Services. When you use Eco’s Services, you release Eco
              from claims, damages, and demands of every kind — known or
              unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed —
              arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and
              Eco&#x27;s Services. All content you access through Eco&#x27;s
              Services is at your own risk. You’re solely responsible for any
              resulting damage or loss to any party.<br />
            </p>
            <h2>Terminating Your Account</h2>
            <p>
              You may cancel your account at any time by sending an email to
              support@eco.com. We also reserve the right to terminate your
              account and your use of Eco&#x27;s Services at any time, for any
              reason, at our sole discretion. All provisions of this agreement
              survive termination of an account.<br />
            </p>
            <h2>Warranty Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
              ECO&#x27;S SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES.
              WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED
              WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
              QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING
              OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no warranty
              that Eco&#x27;s Services will meet your requirements or be
              available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis.<br />
            </p>
            <h2>Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              If you do something that gets us sued, or breaks any of the
              promises you make in these Terms, you agree to indemnify and hold
              Eco harmless from and against any claims, disputes, demands,
              liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including,
              without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising
              out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of
              Eco&#x27;s Services, or (ii) your violation of these Terms. We
              reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of
              any matter otherwise subject to this indemnification clause, in
              which case you agree that you’ll cooperate and help us in
              asserting any defenses.<br />
            </p>
            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              NEITHER ECO NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING,
              OR DELIVERING ECO&#x27;S SERVICES, NOR ANY THIRD PARTY SUPPLIER,
              WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR
              CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (I) RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF,
              OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE ECO&#x27;S SERVICES; (II) FOR ANY
              LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
              SERVICES; OR (III) FOR ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY
              ON THE WEBSITE. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES
              EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID OR IS PAYABLE BY YOU FOR THE
              TRANSACTION THROUGH ECO&#x27;S SERVICES RELATED TO YOUR SPECIFIC
              CLAIM OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100 USD) IF YOU HAVE NOT INITIATED
              ANY TRANSACTIONS THROUGH ECO&#x27;S SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE.<br />
            </p>
            <h2>Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
              Eco encourages you to contact us at support@eco.com if you have
              any issues. If a dispute does arise, these Terms and any related
              action will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal
              arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without
              regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as described in
              Section 21 “Dispute Resolution for Consumers,” the exclusive
              jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Eco are
              not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts
              located in the Northern District of California, and you and Eco
              each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
            </p>
            <ol role="list">
              <li>
                Our goal is to provide you with great service, so we’ll try our
                best to resolve any disagreements that you have with us. If we
                can’t, then you and we both agree to resolve disputes related to
                your use of Eco&#x27;s Services or these Terms (each, a “Claim”)
                in binding arbitration instead of court, except that (a) a Claim
                may be brought in small claims court if it qualifies for it and
                (b) either party may bring suit in court to enjoin the
                infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
              </li>
              <li>
                You agree to give an opportunity to resolve any disputes or
                claims related in any way to our Services, any dealings with our
                third party providers, customer service agents, services
                provided, or our Privacy Policy by contacting our customer
                services line at support@eco.com. If we are not able to resolve
                your claims within sixty (60) days, you may seek other relief as
                described below.
              </li>
              <li>
                We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out
                of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination,
                enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of
                Eco&#x27;s Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved
                solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class,
                representative or consolidated action or proceeding. However, if
                for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in
                arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.
              </li>
              <li>
                As limited exceptions to subsection (a) above: (i) you may seek
                to resolve a Dispute in small claims court If it qualifies; and
                (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other
                equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the
                infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property
                rights. In addition, you will retain the right to opt out of
                arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute if you provide us
                with written notice of your desire to do so by email at
                support@eco.com or by regular mail at 637 Natoma Street #9, San
                Francisco, CA 94103 within thirty (30) days following the date
                you first agree to these Terms.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you want to begin arbitrating a Dispute, you must send a
                letter to us at the following address requesting arbitration and
                describing the Dispute: 637 Natoma Street #9, San Francisco, CA
                94103. If we want to begin arbitrating a Dispute, we’ll send
                such a letter to you at the email address or street address that
                you provided.
              </li>
              <li>
                The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration
                Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the
                “AAA Rules”) or a comparable arbitral body (e.g., JAMS), in the
                event the AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration). The AAA
                Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
                The arbitration may be conducted in writing, remotely (e.g., by
                videoconference) or in-person in the county where you live (or
                at some other location that we both agree to).
              </li>
              <li>
                Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will
                be governed by the AAA Rules. We’ll pay for all filing,
                administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your Dispute
                is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your
                Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of
                our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them
                from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to
                an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided
                under applicable law.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph IX, if Eco
              changes any of the terms of this Section after the date you first
              accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these
              Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written
              notice (including by email to support@eco.com) within 30 days of
              the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last
              Updated” date above or in the date of Eco’s email to you notifying
              you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that
              you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Eco in accordance
              with the terms of this Section as of the date you first accepted
              these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
            </p>
            <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and
              agreement between Eco and you regarding Eco&#x27;s Services. These
              Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written
              understandings or agreements between Eco and you regarding
              Eco&#x27;s Services. If any provision of these Terms is held
              invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent
              jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum
              extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will
              remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer
              these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Eco’s prior
              written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these
              Terms, without such consent, will be null. Eco may freely assign
              or transfer these Terms without restriction.
            </p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li>
                Any notices or other communications provided by Eco under these
                Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms,
                will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to Eco&#x27;s
                Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will
                be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
              </li>
              <li>
                Eco’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
                will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The
                waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if
                in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
                Eco. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise
                by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be
                without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or
                otherwise.
