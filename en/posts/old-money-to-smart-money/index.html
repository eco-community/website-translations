            <h3>
              How Eco saves—and makes—you money<em> </em>(plus: crypto
              <em>actually</em> explained for the first time)
            </h3>
            <p>
              For most people, seeing is believing<em>: </em>once they test out
              Eco and confirm that the benefits we’re offering are real, they
              become our champions and invite everyone they know to the app. But
              some people need to hear more first. If you’re reading this, odds
              are you’re one of these people.
            </p>
            <p>
              You&#x27;re probably wondering a few things about Eco. How does
              the 2.5% (and up to 5%) APY work? What about the 5% cash back? How
              do people get comfortable <em>without</em> FDIC insurance? How
              does Eco make money, and is it sustainable?
            </p>
            <p>
              It&#x27;s totally reasonable to wonder how we can offer benefits
              that beat almost every other product on the market (by a lot). And
              while our mission is to make your money work for you, it&#x27;s
              just as important that we build a sustainable business that can
              serve you forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              To understand how we’re able to offer the benefits we do requires
              at least a high-level understanding of how today’s financial
              system works—and more specifically, how it<em> doesn’t. </em
              ><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              While the financial infrastructure that underpins today&#x27;s
              financial system was once state of the art, the reality is that
              its last major update came in the 1970s. Most of modern “fintech”
              is just shiny interfaces attempting to hide this crumbling
              foundation. If you want to understand how a better product—and
              model—can be built, you need to get into some of the nuts and
              bolts. Thankfully, we&#x27;re up for diving into the details as
              deeply as you want (as long as you remember that
              <em>you&#x27;re</em> the one asking to go deeper!). 
            </p>
            <p>
              But first, we&#x27;ll give you some short answers. The common
              thread: Eco cuts out inefficiencies in the financial system, and
              then Eco passes the gains back to you.
            </p>
            <h3>How does the APY work?</h3>
            <p>
              When you deposit money at your bank, they loan it back out in the
              form of mortgages, small business loans, credit cards, and more.
              This year, they&#x27;ve generally made about 2.6% annualized, and
              over the past 20-or-so years, it&#x27;s been 3-4%.
            </p>
            <p>
              They then turn around and pay you... almost nothing. Usually
              0.01-0.05% annually. Sometimes literally nothing. Today, in the
              best case, they&#x27;ll pay around 0.60%.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eco puts your money back to work for <em>you</em> instead of
              working for a bank. The upside from your money goes straight into
              your pocket.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plus, the average American household pays an
              <em>additional</em> $329 in fees to their bank each year. We
              don&#x27;t charge any (ever). And those savings are effectively
              added to your annual earnings, too.
            </p>
            <p>
              And on top of that, we&#x27;re able to get you access to more
              appealing rates by removing ourselves from the bureaucracy of a
              big bank and actively seeking out the best opportunities for you.
              So we get you higher rates than the banks can pay.
            </p>
            <h3>And what about the cashback?</h3>
            <p>
              Again: middlemen. Every time you buy something from a merchant, a
              half-dozen intermediaries you&#x27;ve never heard of take their
              cut. When you swipe your credit card in a store, your money
              doesn’t go straight to them (like it does when you hand them
              cash). 
            </p>
            <p>
              In such a transaction, your money passes through the bank that
              issued you the card (aka “the issuer”), the bank that represents
              the merchant (“the acquirer”), and often a payments facilitator.
              On top of this, VISA or Mastercard, the networks that connect this
              web of parties, charge a fee as well (“interchange”). All
              together, for most merchants, this adds up somewhere over 3% on
              every transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you buy something online, tack on another 1% to that list for
              their ecommerce software. Finally, if you’ve bought something you
              found online via Google or Instagram or Facebook, the merchant
              pays them what is often an extra 25-50%+ of the purchase price<em
                >.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              You know what a better solution would be? For you and the merchant
              to connect directly, and for you to get the savings from cutting
              out those parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              That&#x27;s what we enable — direct payments to merchants. Money
              in your Eco account can go straight to them. Because cutting out
              the card networks saves the merchants money, they’re willing to
              support it. And in many cases, they’re even willing to incentivize
              it (remember how much merchants are willing to pay Google for
              sending them a customer). This is where the cashback comes
              from.<em>‍</em>
            </p>
            <h3>Okay, but Eco isn&#x27;t FDIC insured?<br /></h3>
            <p>
              We’ve spoken one-on-one to thousands of people of all stripes over
              the past year, and roughly 95% of people fall into one of four
              categories:
            </p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li>People who live paycheck to paycheck</li>
              <li>
                People with $5-40k sitting in their bank account who may save a
                little bit
              </li>
              <li>
                People aggressively invested in the stock market (or sometimes
                crypto!)
              </li>
              <li>People who are affluent</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Turns out: for each of those groups, we’ve found FDIC insurance
              doesn’t matter — but for a different reason for each of them. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Unraveling this one takes a little more time. If you’re curious,

            <h3>How does Eco make money?</h3>
            <p>
              This alone sounds too good to be true — but it&#x27;s, well, the
              truth.
            </p>
            <p>We&#x27;re aligned with you.</p>
            <p>
              Every time you do anything in Eco — save, spend, refer friends —
              you earn Eco Points. They don’t do much today, but one day they
              will. Our business model is to try to make these Points as useful
              as possible over time. In fact: our whole team has a chunk of our
              personal compensation tied to the success of Eco Points.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine a world where Amex executives got paid in Amex points, or
              Chase employees in Chase points. What do you think they’d do?
            </p>
            <p>
              We think they’d probably try to do the right thing by their
              customers — they’d try to make those points as useful as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              There&#x27;s much more to get into on this (remember: these are
              the short answers). But the reality is: unlike every other
              financial product out there, we don&#x27;t need to take money out
              of your pocket. We only win when you do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plus, there&#x27;s another level: we&#x27;re trying to make Eco
              your primary wallet for saving, spending, and more. If we do our
              jobs well, you should send your whole paycheck into Eco.

              The rest of this post will give you a peek behind the curtains.
              You’ll understand why the banks aren’t entirely the greedy
              rent-seekers you’ve been made to believe, and how the only way
              they can survive is to take a piece of the action every time your
              money moves (and when it sits, too).<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Eco is building a better model — and doing that means not being a
              bank. It means leaving the existing system and departing from
              today’s business models.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              So, if you’re one of the many people who <em>still</em> think this
              is too good to be true — but are willing to read about why it
              might not be — buckle up.<br />
            </p>
            <p>We’ll cover:</p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li>
                how banks make money (hint: pushing you into bad personal
                decisions)
              </li>
              <li>
                how money moves (spoiler: even electronic transfers aren’t
                always so electronic)
              </li>
              <li>
                what the hot new fintech companies are doing (putting lipstick
                on a pig)
              </li>
              <li>
                how blockchain can play a part in fixing this (no, really —
                plus, we’ll even explain it to you simply for the first time)
              </li>
              <li>and much more</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <br />If you’d rather experience this new world instead of reading
              about it, well, sign up below. It’s just the beginning for us, but
              you’ll already see how we’re putting your money back to work for
              you.
